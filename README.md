## Project Goals

- Create a platform for exercise enthusiasts to come together and share their activities and passion for exercise and the outdoors. This will be achieved through CRUD functionality to create activities (with the ability to both edit and delete the chosen activity) that allow for other users to comment and interact with fellow users of the site.

- Create a website for people in search of a walking or cycling tour of Paris and the suburbs.

## Deployment

### Heroku Deployment

1. Create a new app in the Heroku dashboard. Choose a name and location for your app.

2. Click the resources tab to add the Heroku Postgres database.

3. Click on the settings tab and reveal config vars. Copy the DATABASE_URL and paste it into the env.py file in your project. Make sure that the env.py file is in the .gitignore file.

4. Add a SECRET_KEY both to the env.py file and in the config vars on Heroku.

5. In the Gitpod settings.py file, remove the insecure SECRET_KEY and replace it with the environment variable (SECRET_KEY) that was created.

6. Replace existing DATABASES section in settings.py file with the DATABASE_URL environment variable that is located in the env.py file.

7. Ensure that all static and files have been added to the settings.py file in Gitpod.

8. Add the TEMPLATES_DIR to settings.py file in Gitpod and link it in the TEMPLATES section.

9. Make sure that the project name for the Heroku app has been added as an allowed host in Gitpod.

10. Ensure to create a Procfile and add web: gunicorn activities.wsgi to this file

11. Make sure that the DEBUG flag is set to False in settings.py file in Gitpod

12. Add X_FRAME OPTIONS = 'SAMEORIGIN' to the settings.py file to ensure that the Summernote editor works once the project is deployed.

13. Make sure that all dependencies have been added to the requirements.txt file using the command pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

If deploying through the CLI:

Using the CLI, enter the following commands to deploy to Heroku

1. Login to Heroku using the command heroku login -i

2. Enter your email address and password

3. Find the relevant app using the command heroku apps

4. Set the Heroku remote using the command heroku git:remote -a <app_name>

5. Add, commit and push to Github using the command git add . && git commit -m "Deploy to Heroku via CLI"

6. Push to both Github and Heroku using the command git push origin main (for Github) and the command git push heroku main (for Heroku)
